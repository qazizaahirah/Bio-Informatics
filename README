I am working on my masters of computer Science. This repository will have the code that I used in reseacrh.
The code is very specific to my research needs. Each file will have a little note describing the what the functions do. Some of 
functions use PDBnet http://labblouin.github.io/LabBlouinTools/labblouin.PDBnet.html
